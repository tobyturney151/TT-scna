# TT-scna

## Summary
This package will perform single-channel noise analysis on an electrophysiological trace containing whole-cell currents recorded during the presence or absence of an activating stimulus.

Originally designed for use on whole-cell currents from HEK cells expressing channel rhodopsins, and being exposed to 'light' and 'dark' conditions. Please see the literature below for a (1) paper which inspired this work, and (2) an excellent review on single-channel noise analysis.

## Usage:

    pip install ttscna
    from ttscna import ttscna
    ttscna.ttscna(file_name, on_start, off_start, sweep_len = 5.0, sample_rate = 20000, skip_rows = 9, sep = "\t", fmin = 20.0, fmax = 10000.0)

## Doc-String
Takes as input a text file containing electrophysiological data in two conditions.
Computes the difference in single-channel noise between the two conditions.

Must contain one column, with time, expressed in seconds,
and a second column, with current, expressed in picoamps.

Inputs
----------
file_name: str
    Path and File_name to text data file.

on_start: float
    Start time of 'on' condition.

off_start: float
    Start time of 'off' condition.

sweep_len: float
    Length of time, in seconds, of each condition to analyze.

sample_rate: float
    Sampling rate of the time series, in Hz.

skip_rows: int
    Rows to skip in the header of the data file.

sep: str
    Delimiter used in each column for the data file.

fmin: float
    Minimum frequency to fit to, in Hz.

fmax: float
    Maximum frequency to fit to, in Hz.

Output
----------
Figure: .png
    A 4-panel plot containing:
        
    100 microsecond traces of the On and Off conditions.
    
    Overlaid power spectra from both conditions.
        
    The power spectra of the on condition minus the off condition, 
    overlaid with a Lorentzian model.
